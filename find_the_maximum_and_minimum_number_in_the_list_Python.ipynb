        "This program first defines a function called find_max_min() that takes a list of numbers as input and returns the maximum and minimum numbers in the list. The function works by first initializing two variables, max_number and min_number, to the first element in the list. Then, it iterates through the list and compares each number to the current values of max_number and min_number. If the number is greater than max_number, then max_number is updated to the new number. Similarly, if the number is less than min_number, then min_number is updated to the new number. The function then returns max_number and min_number.\n",
